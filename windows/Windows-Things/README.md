# Windows Scripts

## Credit

These scripts have been adapted from [https://github.com/bwcybersec/ccdc]

## Clean dumps

A clean install of various versions of windows was created, and the script was run on them.
The output is in one of the folders

- `win10`: Windows 10
- `win2012`: Windows Server 2012
- `win2016`: Windows Server 2016

Note: the hlkm registry file has been zipped since Git has a 100MB file limit.
